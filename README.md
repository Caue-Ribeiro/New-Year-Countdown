# New Year Countdown

### Hello world! Here I am again with another project, this time creating a countdown for the year of 2023. Despite being a simple project, it helped me with my logical thinking wich I'm working to sharpen more and more. And I also practiced my css skills.

### For this project I've used:

-   Vanilla JS
-   SASS
